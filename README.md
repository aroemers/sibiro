# sibiro

Bidirectional routing using datastructures for Clojure and ClojureScript.

## Why?

I found the available data-driven, bidirectional routing libraries too hard to use and bloated.

## Usage

Add `[functionalbytes/sibiro "0.1"]` to your dependencies. Read the docstrings in the source or perform a `lein codox` on your local clone.
